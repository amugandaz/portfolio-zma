                    The project involves developing a Spring Boot RESTful web service and an Angular client application for managing a bookstore's data. 
                    The backend API, backed by a MySQL database, supports CRUD operations for entities like books, authors, and orders while adhering to the HATEOAS principles to include hyperlinks in API responses. 
                    The API also integrates with SpringDoc to generate OpenAPI documentation. 
                    The Angular client interacts with this API for data retrieval and manipulation, such as adding books and authors or querying author details. 
                    The project requires extending the application by adding a menu option to display author information based on user input, ensuring robust interaction between the client and the RESTful API.

                </h3>
                <p>Java, VS Code, GitHub</p>
                <p>
                    This project focuses on the implementation and application of the DBScan (Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise) algorithm, a popular clustering technique widely used for its ability to discover clusters of arbitrary shape and effectively handle noise in datasets. Unlike traditional clustering algorithms such as K-Means, DBScan does not require the number of clusters to be specified in advance. Instead, it relies on two key parameters—epsilon (ε), which defines the neighborhood radius, and MinPts, the minimum number of points required to form a dense region.
                    The project is divided into three main components: the core implementation of DBScan, experimental setups to evaluate the algorithm, and a detailed report documenting the results. The implementation leverages efficient data structures like KD-Trees and nearest neighbor search algorithms to optimize the clustering process, particularly for large datasets or high-dimensional spaces.
                    <p>
                        Experiments are conducted on synthetic datasets with varying complexity:
                        <ul>
                            <li>•	Exp1: Single Dominant Cluster, which explores clustering on a dataset with a single dominant cluster to validate the algorithm's ability to group dense regions accurately.</li>
                            <li>•	Exp2: Two Distinct Clusters, which evaluates DBScan's performance on a dataset containing two distinct clusters, highlighting its precision in identifying separable groups.</li>
                            <li>•	Exp3: Three Clusters with Noise, which applies the algorithm to a more complex dataset with three clusters and regions of noise, showcasing DBScan's strength in distinguishing clusters of varying density and ignoring outliers effectively.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </p>
                    The project outcomes demonstrate how DBScan adapts to different datasets without requiring prior assumptions about the number of clusters. 
                    This flexibility, combined with its robustness to noise, makes DBScan a valuable tool for real-world applications, including geospatial analysis, anomaly detection, and image segmentation. 
                    The detailed report further elaborates on parameter tuning, challenges encountered, and the insights gained from the experiments.
                    By providing a comprehensive exploration of DBScan, this project highlights its versatility and effectiveness in clustering tasks, making it a vital algorithm in the field of unsupervised machine learning.

                    The project involves generating data in CSV format using Python scripts and leveraging it to create interactive dashboards in Power BI. 
                    The Python scripts handle data extraction, cleaning, and transformation from various sources, preparing it for analysis. 
                    The CSV files are then imported into Power BI, where the data is modeled and visualized through dynamic dashboards tailored for specific use cases, such as analyzing car manufacturers' performance, football team statistics, NBA team insights, and NHL team data. 
                    The combination of Python and Power BI ensures a streamlined process for data-driven decision-making and interactive exploration.
